## Why? [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

I have two setups with Elementary OS, so I'm constantly trying to keep the applications and settings on these two setups in sync.

I will likely update this document when the next version of Elementary OS is released, because that would likely mean another clean install of the operating system on both of my setups.

## What?

The open source nature of the Linux ecosystem means that users can customise aspects of the operating system to their whims and likes. The most common and widely supported way is through the command line.

## How?

### Installation

1. Check if your operating system is 32-bit or 64-bit.

   - _Elementary OS can only run on 64-bit systems_

   On **Windows**, right-click **This PC** in Windows Explorer. The System Properties will display if your computer is 32-bit or 64-bit.

   On **Mac**, run `getconf LONG_BIT` in the command line.

2. Download the [Elementary OS ISO](https://elementary.io/) and follow the [installation instructions](https://elementary.io/docs/installation#installation).

   - I generally prefer the use of [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) instead of UNetbootin.

3. If it is your first time using Linux or Elementary OS, I would highly recommend reading the [basics](https://elementary.io/docs/learning-the-basics) to get yourself started.
